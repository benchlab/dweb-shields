# dWeb Shields
Below are several dWeb Shields for any sort of dWeb-based project. That includes those who use the dWeb's distributed repository. There is also a [dWeb Standard README](https://github.com/benchlab/dweb-standard-readme) for those who want to be as uniform as possible with other official dWeb projects. Below is a collection of dWeb Shields and how it works.

## How It Works
dWeb Shields are generated by our [dWeb Shields Server](https://github.com/benchlab/dweb-shields-server) at `https://dweb-shields.herokuapp.com`. 

**NOTE**: Once we move to production, we plan on updating the URL but the Heroku URL will always remain active. 

### Custom Shields
If you want to create a custom shield, it's very easy. Simply use the following API schema below:

```
https://dweb-shields.herokuapp.com/dwebshield/leftText/rightText/color
```

Boom! New dWeb Shield. 

### Formatting A Custom Shield For Markdown:
Take the URL from the [Custom Shields](#custom-shields) section above and do like so:

```
[![dWebShield](https://dweb-shields.herokuapp.com/dwebshield/dweb/custom/lightgreen)](https://https://github.com/benchlab/dweb-shields)
```

Paste that code in your README.md file and you're set!
